**Q[1]: Do a supervised classification by using Sentinel-2 for your upazila, export the classified image, prepare fine-tuned map.**

Ans: A Supervised Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) map classifies different land use types such as forests, water bodies, urban areas, and agricultural fields using supervised remote sensing techniques. This involves collecting training data from satellite images, training a classification algorithm, and applying it to categorize the entire image. These maps are highly accurate with good training data and offer detailed land cover information. They are used in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and agriculture. However, they require extensive training data and expertise in remote sensing and GIS for implementation. Supervised LULC maps are valuable tools for managing and understanding land resources, aiding decision-making in various fields.

**Q[2]: Do a unsupervised classification by using Landsat-9 for your upazila, export the classified image, prepare fine-tuned map.**

Ans: An Unsupervised Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) map categorizes land cover types without using labeled training data. Instead, an algorithm like K-means or ISODATA groups pixels into clusters based on their spectral properties. These clusters are then interpreted and labeled by an analyst. This method is useful for initial analysis in unfamiliar areas and is rapid and cost-effective, though it may be less accurate and specific than supervised methods. Unsupervised LULC maps are valuable for exploratory analysis, baseline studies, and rapid assessments in environmental monitoring and resource management.
